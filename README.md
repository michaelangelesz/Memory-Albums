## Memory-Albums

Memory was a favorite game when I was a kid, so it has been fun recreating it here. 

The theme of this game is music albums! I relish any opportunity to share my favorites.

Please enjoy my game! It is fun to look at.

In building this project, I referred to the following resources:
